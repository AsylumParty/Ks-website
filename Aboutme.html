        <div class="paracont">        <p class="para">     Kaia is a multi-cultural, intelligent, & creative <i>Powerhouse</i> of a modern woman.
        Originally from Central Florida, Kaia is a hidden gem among the attractions and natural beauty.
        Not only does she complement the landscape with her own angelic looks, but her mind also complements the rich culture found in the area.
        Below you will be to see a list of her skills, although this list is not exhuastive by any means as she is a versatile person.
        Currently studying at Valencia College, Kaia's current path is to become a professional dental hygienist!
        At the same time she works as <b>the nicest</b> cashier at Petsmart. Though no matter what she does, it's with grace and an amptitude that would make any team extremely lucky to have her. - Written December 2020</p> </div>
